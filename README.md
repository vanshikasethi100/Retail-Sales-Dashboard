# Retail-Sales-Dashboard
This project focuses on transforming a raw, unstructured dataset into a clean and interactive analytical dashboard using Power BI. The goal was to make the dataset visualization-ready and generate meaningful business insights that can support data-driven decision-making.

The workflow began with data preparation in Power Query. Multiple cleaning steps were performed such as handling missing values, correcting data types, removing duplicates, standardizing text fields, and converting numeric month values into proper month names for better readability. Columns were optimized to ensure consistency and reliability before loading into the data model.

After cleaning, relationships were structured to build an efficient data model. Several calculated columns and DAX measures were created to analyze performance metrics like total sales, category contribution, gender-wise distribution, and time-based trends. Special attention was given to writing accurate measures and validating outputs to avoid incorrect percentages or aggregations.

The dashboard was then designed to be simple, readable, and recruiter-friendly. It includes interactive visuals such as clustered column charts, area charts, and table visuals with slicers for filtering by time, category, and demographics. Formatting techniques like rounded bars, consistent color usage, and structured layout were applied to improve user experience and storytelling.

Key Highlights:
1) End-to-end data cleaning and transformation using Power Query
2) Creation of DAX measures for KPI analysis
3) Interactive and user-friendly dashboard design
4) Focus on accurate business insights and readability
